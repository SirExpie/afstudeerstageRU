NOTES

To do: create report: how many reads map back to metagenome/sample

Idea: Remove sam/unsorted.bam files, metaspades: K* merged_R* tmp/ corrected/

Idea: Run binning in parallel

Function: allow user to supply genes of interest; blast these genes, create table: contig;bin;query;pid;eval;aln-len

Function: Prokka annotation for most complete/pure bins

Function: place bins in tree

Idea: different contig length cutoffs for binning methods
Note: including MANY small contigs (A LOT of asm bp) may have big impact (more weight) during binning, as focus shift/weight decreasess from long, high quality contigs

Idea: split up large contigs so they get more weight in analysis, remerge after binning

Idea: more stringent mapping may improve binning (especially when many highly similar strains are present)

Idea: provide input for downstream analysis with mmgenome/anvio

Generate final output folder.
